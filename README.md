# Some-Messy-Factors-about-Luoxiaohei
## A Brief Introduction
The Legend of (Luoxiao)Hei is an animation from China, written and directed by a Chinese independent director MTJJ(really named ZHANG Ping(章平)). The Animation itself tells a rather boring story about the adventures and daily life of Luo Xiaohei, a black cat spirit.
This animation is long-term highly regarded by fan-toxic as "A flawless jade", the reason why they are keen on bullying anyone who gives lower rates. Enraptured by the toxic fandom that protects the Hanmuchunhua corporation limited, everyone in this company is 1000% blabbermouth, also known as trolls that makes troubles on the social media.

Some typical conflicts are listed and inscribed below.
## Conflicts with Black Myth: Wukong
That controversy which was once bubbling over was with Black Myth: Wukong by Game Science(Hangzhou), the first-ever 3A game from China, thus regarded as "the first university student in our village"(due to the poor condition of Chinese console game).

On June 11th,a comment saying "Wukong's being discredited is due to the conflicts of the two genders that have already been existing in China, no responsibility abroad(he has neglected some NGOs)" was forwarded by Sun Gua(孙呱，Really named LI Le(李乐)), the illustrator of Lanxi Zhen(alternatively titled The Legend of Luo Xiaohei: Junqing Arc marking its profile of Luoxiaohei's audience),attaching "So charming of you to whitewash the game before launch".

Li's motive was after witnessing the theories from the developers of BMW, in which there was some incomplete but not malicious gender perspective, take "No need female players to attract opposingly(since the original text is truly illogical)" for instance, it is just to satirize those who use pornography to attract male gamers, but was misinter-preted as "no female gamers needed", one of the aggressive player truly stated this when attacking a female user accusing BMW for degrading women, which convinced the feminists NGOs and so as its followers.

At the sight of Li's controversial statements, the BMW players were cross about this false accusation, so works about Luoxiaohei, mostly the comic Lanxi Zhen, was then occupied by the negative reviews from the disgruntled viewers.

On June 18th, one week after Li's ravings, MTJJ posted a belated ingenuous apologies——but had only stirred up more anger. The real problem that lay(past form since it's no longer able  to be seen in his Weibo account) in his article was that he regarded it right that every netizen must pay for every one words from years back, additionally all the dislikes from some spicy stuffs were obliged to endure, "No room for disagreement". Even worse, the director even justified the behavior(that Steam disagrees) of dragging the author down with one's comments.


This apology backfired in terms of placating various people, so the Animation itself was occupied by the negative comments as well, for the manga, the condition worsened. 
Even worse, MTJJ's past spicy jokes was dug up, Some even involved Pedophilia, spreading jokes of his son.

Another factor that expelled their core fans was the exposure of abandonment of the cat Xiaohei(小黑, Little Black), the prototype of the cat spirit in the animation. This had ignited even more people including animalists, who dislikes the stray cats that do harm to the environment by consuming tons of fowls that eat pests. Being a cartoon hyped as cat-friendly, this is undoubtedly a lethal strike, their fame fully tarnished.

In conclusion, this controversy remains, even long after the release
## Conflicts with Nezha the movie
This one is relative mild, for MTJJ was not intended(so he didn't) to say the typically aggresive words that acts as boomerang
